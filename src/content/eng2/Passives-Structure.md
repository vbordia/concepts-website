## 1. Structure of Passives

In English, a passive sentence is formed by altering the typical subject-verb-object order of an active sentence. The structure of a passive sentence is:

- **Active Voice:** Subject + Verb + Object
- **Passive Voice:** Object (now the subject) + Auxiliary Verb (to be) + Past Participle + (optional) Agent

### Example

- **Active:** The chef cooks the meal.
- **Passive:** The meal is cooked (by the chef).

### Steps to Form a Passive Sentence

1. **Identify the Object** in the active sentence.
2. **Move the Object** to the subject position of the passive sentence.
3. **Insert an Auxiliary Verb** ("to be") in a form that matches the tense of the main verb.
4. **Change the Main Verb** to its past participle form.
5. **Optionally Include the Agent** with "by."

## 2. Canonical Passives

Canonical passives are straightforward transformations of active sentences into passive form without changing their basic meaning.

### Example

- **Active:** The committee approved the proposal.
- **Passive:** The proposal was approved by the committee.

### Detailed Transformation

- **Active Sentence:** The committee (subject) approved (verb) the proposal (object).
- **Passive Sentence:** The proposal (subject) was approved (auxiliary verb + past participle) by the committee (agent).

## 3. Subject-Object Dilemma: Grammatical Relations vs. Thematic/Logical/Semantic Contents

In passives, there is often a shift between grammatical relations (who does what to whom) and thematic roles (the underlying meanings like agent, patient).

### Example

- **Active:** The teacher explains the lesson.
  - **Grammatical Relation:** The teacher (subject) explains (verb) the lesson (object).
  - **Thematic Role:** The teacher (agent) performs the action; the lesson (patient) is affected by the action.
- **Passive:** The lesson is explained by the teacher.
  - **Grammatical Relation:** The lesson (subject) is explained (verb) by the teacher (agent).
  - **Thematic Role:** The lesson (patient) is affected by the action; the teacher (agent) performs the action.

### Illustration

| Role             | Active Voice                  | Passive Voice                      |
|------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Grammatical**  | The teacher (subject)         | The lesson (subject)               |
| **Relations**    | explains (verb) the lesson    | is explained (verb) by the teacher |
| **Thematic**     | The teacher (agent)           | The teacher (agent)                |
| **Roles**        | explains the lesson (patient) | explains the lesson (patient)      |

## 4. Indirect Objects in Passive

Verbs with both direct and indirect objects can promote the indirect object to the subject in the passive voice.

### Example

- **Active:** The manager gave the employee a bonus.
  - **Direct Object:** A bonus
  - **Indirect Object:** The employee
- **Passive with Direct Object as Subject:** A bonus was given to the employee by the manager.
- **Passive with Indirect Object as Subject:** The employee was given a bonus by the manager.

### Detailed Transformation

- **Active Sentence:** The manager (subject) gave (verb) the employee (indirect object) a bonus (direct object).
- **Passive Sentence (Direct Object):** A bonus (subject) was given (auxiliary verb + past participle) to the employee (prepositional phrase) by the manager (agent).
- **Passive Sentence (Indirect Object):** The employee (subject) was given (auxiliary verb + past participle) a bonus (direct object) by the manager (agent).

## 5. Restrictions in Promotions

Certain constructions resist passivization due to inherent characteristics or semantic constraints:

### 5.1 Intransitive Verbs

Intransitive verbs, which do not have a direct object, cannot form passives.

- **Active:** The baby cried.
- **Passive:** *Not possible* (No object to promote to subject)

### 5.2 Verbs of Perception and Cognition

Some verbs related to perception or cognition are awkward or unnatural when passivized.

- **Active:** She knows the answer.
- **Passive:** The answer is known by her. (*Uncommon or awkward*)

### 5.3 Fixed Phrases and Idiomatic Expressions

Idiomatic expressions often lose meaning or become awkward in passive form.

- **Active:** He took advantage of the situation.
- **Passive:** *The situation was taken advantage of by him.* (*Awkward*)

## 6. Functions of Passives

Passives serve various functions in English, including emphasis, formality, and tact.

### 6.1 Emphasis on the Action or Result

The passive can emphasize the action itself or its result rather than who performed it.

- **Example:** The masterpiece was completed in 2021.

### 6.2 Unknown or Irrelevant Agent

The passive is useful when the agent is unknown, unimportant, or implied.

- **Example:** The documents were stolen.

### 6.3 Formality and Objectivity

Passives can create a formal tone and are often used to achieve objectivity.

- **Example:** The data were analyzed.

### 6.4 Avoidance of Blame

Passives can obscure the agentâ€™s identity, which can deflect responsibility.

- **Example:** Mistakes were made.

## 7. Examples: Transformations

Transforming the same sentence between active and passive forms highlights differences and use cases.

### Example 1

- **Active:** The company launched a new product.
- **Passive:** A new product was launched by the company.

### Example 2

- **Active:** The gardener is watering the plants.
- **Passive:** The plants are being watered by the gardener.

### Example 3

- **Active:** The committee will review the applications.
- **Passive:** The applications will be reviewed by the committee.

### Example 4

- **Active:** The researchers conducted the experiment.
- **Passive:** The experiment was conducted by the researchers.

### Example 5

- **Active:** She gave him a book.
