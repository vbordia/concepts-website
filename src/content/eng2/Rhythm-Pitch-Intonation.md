## Rhythm

**Rhythm** in English refers to the pattern of stresses or beats in spoken language. It's the timing and flow with which syllables, words, and sentences are spoken. English is considered a **stress-timed** language, meaning that stressed syllables occur at regular intervals, and the unstressed syllables are shortened to fit this timing.

### Features of Rhythm:
1. **Stress Patterns:** Certain syllables within words are stressed more than others, creating a beat.
   - **Example:** The word *"beautiful"* has the stress on the first syllable: **BEAU**-ti-ful.
2. **Connected Speech:** In natural speech, words are connected, and their pronunciation may change to maintain the rhythm.
   - **Example:** "What are you doing?" often sounds like *"Whatcha doin'?"*.
3. **Timing:** English speakers tend to speak in a rhythm where stressed syllables occur at regular intervals.

### Examples:
- *"I went to the **mar**ket yesterday."* (Stressed syllables: **mar**-ket, **yes**-ter-day)
- *"She's **dri**ving me **cra**zy!"* (Stressed syllables: **dri**-ving, **cra**-zy)

## Pitch

**Pitch** refers to the frequency of sound in speech. It determines how high or low a tone sounds. Changes in pitch can convey different meanings or emotions and are essential in distinguishing between statements, questions, and other types of sentences.

### Features of Pitch:
1. **High vs. Low Pitch:** Pitch can vary from high to low. High pitch often indicates questions or excitement, while low pitch may suggest statements or calmness.
2. **Pitch Range:** The range between the highest and lowest pitches in a speaker's voice.
3. **Pitch Contours:** The shape of the pitch movement across an utterance, such as rising or falling.

### Examples:
- **Rising Pitch:** Indicates a question or uncertainty.
  - *"Are you coming?"* (The pitch rises at the end.)
- **Falling Pitch:** Indicates a statement or command.
  - *"She is coming."* (The pitch falls at the end.)
- **Pitch Variation:** Can indicate emphasis or surprise.
  - *"I **did** see him!"* (Emphasis on "**did**")

## Intonation

**Intonation** refers to the variation of pitch across a sentence. It provides additional meaning beyond the words themselves and helps convey the speaker's attitude, emotions, and the structure of the sentence.

### Features of Intonation:
1. **Rising Intonation:** Often used in yes/no questions and to express uncertainty or politeness.
   - *"You're coming, **aren't you**?"*
2. **Falling Intonation:** Common in statements, commands, and wh- questions.
   - *"Where **is** he?"*
3. **Fall-Rise Intonation:** Used to indicate doubt, uncertainty, or a polite request.
   - *"Well, I **suppose** so..."*
4. **Intonational Patterns:** Different patterns can convey different functions like listing items, expressing surprise, or highlighting contrast.

### Examples:
- **Statement:** *"She went to the store."* (Falling intonation)
- **Question:** *"Did she go to the store?"* (Rising intonation)
- **Uncertainty:** *"I think she went to the store?"* (Fall-Rise intonation)

## Summary

- **Rhythm** focuses on the timing and stress patterns in speech, creating a flow and regularity.
- **Pitch** involves the highness or lowness of tones, affecting the perception of questions, statements, and emotions.
- **Intonation** is the variation in pitch over a sentence, crucial for conveying meaning and speaker intent.
