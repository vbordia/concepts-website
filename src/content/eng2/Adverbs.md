## What are Adverbs?

Adverbs are words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. They often provide information about how, when, where, why, or to what extent something happens. For example:

- **Quickly** in "She runs quickly." (modifies the verb *runs*)
- **Very** in "He is very tall." (modifies the adjective *tall*)
- **Quite** in "She sings quite beautifully." (modifies the adverb *beautifully*)

## Adverb Clauses

An adverb clause is a group of words that function as an adverb. They contain a subject and a verb and begin with subordinating conjunctions like *because*, *if*, *when*, etc.

- **Example:** "He left the party **because he was tired**."
  - The clause "because he was tired" explains why he left.

## Adverb Phrases

An adverb phrase is a group of words that act together as an adverb, often starting with a preposition or infinitive.

- **Example:** "She reads **with great enthusiasm**."
  - The phrase "with great enthusiasm" modifies the verb *reads*.

## Types of Adverbs

### 1. Adverbs of Manner

Adverbs of manner describe **how** an action is performed.

- **Examples:**
  - She sings **beautifully**.
  - They worked **diligently**.

### 2. Adverbs of Degree

Adverbs of degree explain **to what extent** something happens or is true.

- **Examples:**
  - The water is **extremely** cold.
  - She was **almost** finished.

### 3. Adverbs of Place/Direction

Adverbs of place or direction tell **where** something happens.

- **Examples:**
  - He looked **everywhere**.
  - She walked **outside**.

### 4. Adverbs of Time/Frequency

Adverbs of time or frequency describe **when** or **how often** something happens.

- **Examples:**
  - We will leave **soon**.
  - She **always** arrives early.

### 5. Sentence Adverbs

Sentence adverbs modify the whole sentence, often providing the speaker's opinion or comment.

- **Examples:**
  - **Unfortunately**, we missed the bus.
  - **Clearly**, he is the best candidate.

### 6. Conjunctive Adverbs

Conjunctive adverbs connect independent clauses and show relationships like contrast, cause, or sequence.

- **Examples:**

  - I wanted to help; **however**, I was too busy.
