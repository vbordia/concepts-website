In linear algebra, the transpose of a matrix is an operation that flips the matrix over its diagonal, switching the row and column indices of each element. For a given matrix $A$, the transpose is denoted by $A^T$.

Mathematically, if 

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
a_{ij}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

then the transpose $A^T$ is given by

$$
A^T = \begin{pmatrix}
a_{ji}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

## Example 1: Transpose of a 2x2 Matrix

Consider the 2x2 matrix 

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The transpose of $A$, denoted by $A^T$, is obtained by swapping its rows and columns:

$$
A^T = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 3 \\
2 & 4
\end{pmatrix}
$$

## Example 2: Transpose of a 3x3 Matrix

Now consider the 3x3 matrix 

$$
B = \begin{pmatrix}
5 & 6 & 7 \\
8 & 9 & 10 \\
11 & 12 & 13
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The transpose of $B$, denoted by $B^T$, is:

$$
B^T = \begin{pmatrix}
5 & 8 & 11 \\
6 & 9 & 12 \\
7 & 10 & 13
\end{pmatrix}
$$
